My
lover
's
got
humor
She
's
the
giggle
at
a
funeral
Knows
everybody
's
disapproval
I
should
've
worshipped
her
sooner
If
the
Heavens
ever
did
speak
She
is
the
last
true
mouthpiece
Every
Sunday
's
getting
more
bleak
A
fresh
poison
each
week
We
were
born
sick
You
heard
them
say
it
My
church
offers
no
absolutes
She
tells
me
worship
in
the
bedroom
The
only
heaven
I
'll
be
sent
to
Is
when
I
'm
alone
with
you
I
was
born
sick
but
I
love
it
Command
me
to
be
well
Amen
amen
amen
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
If
I
'm
a
pagan
of
the
good
times
My
lover
's
the
sunlight
To
keep
the
Goddess
on
my
side
She
demands
a
sacrifice
To
drain
the
whole
sea
get
something
shiny
Something
meaty
for
the
main
course
That
's
a
fine
looking
high
horse
What
you
got
in
the
stable
We
've
a
lot
of
starving
faithful
That
looks
tasty
That
looks
plenty
This
is
hungry
work
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
my
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
my
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
No
masters
or
kings
when
the
ritual
begins
There
is
no
sweeter
innocence
Than
our
gentle
sin
In
the
madness
and
soil
of
that
sad
earthly
scene
Only
then
I
am
human
only
then
I
am
clean
Amen
amen
amen
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
At
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
Take
me

church
I
'll

Hey

Mummified

Heavy
metal

my
Come

on
and
let
me
in
I
'm
bruises
on
your
thighs

And

inside
my
dreams
Until
you
die
for
me
as
long
as
there
's
a
light
my
shadow
's
over
you
Cause
I
I
am
the
opposite
of
amnesia
And
you
're
a
cherry
blossom
you
're
about

You

So

dreams
Would
I
come
running
home
to
you
I
've
told
a
million
lies
But
now
I
tell
a
single
truth
There
's
you
in
everything
I
do
Now
remember
when
I
told
you
that
's
the
last
you
'll
see
of
me
Remember

walked
that
road
before
I
left
you
on
your
own
And
please
believe
them
when
they
say
That
it
's
left
for
yesterday
And
the
records
that
I
've
played
Please
forgive
for
all

She
said

Shut

We
were
victims
of
the
night
The
chemical
physical
kryptonite
Helpless
to
the
bass
and
faded
light
Oh
we
were
born
to
get
together
Born
to
get
together
She
took
my
arm
I
do
n't

We

A
backless
dress
and
some
beat
up
sneaks
My
discoth√®que
Juliet
teenage
dream
I
felt
it
in
my
chest
as
she
looked
at
me
I
knew

were
born
to
be
together
Born
to
be
together
She

Deep
in

I

the
future
I
realize
this
is
my
last
chance
She
took
my
arm
I
do

We

Come

my
nails
on
the
tile
I
just
followed
your
scent
you
can
just
follow
my
smile
All
of
your
flaws
are
aligned
with
this
mood
of
mine
Cutting
me
to
the
bone
nothing
left
to
leave
behind
You
ought
to
keep
me
concealed
just
like
I
was
a
weapon
I
did
n't
come
for
a
fight
but
I
will
fight
til
the
ending
And

Like

by
fixation
Truly

Too
many

Too

Too

You

sky
'cause
you
're
a
sky
full
of
stars
Because
you
light
up
the
path
And
I
do
n't
care
go
on
and
tear
me
apart
And
I
do
n't
care
if
you
do
ooh
'Cause
in
a
sky
'cause
in
a
sky
full
of
stars
I
think
I
saw
you
'Cause
you
're
a
sky
'cause
you
're
a
sky
full
of
stars
I
wan
na
die
in
your
arms
'Cause
you
get
lighter
the
more
it
gets
dark
I
'm
gon
na
give
you
my
heart
And
I
do
n't
care
go
on
and
tear
me
apart
And
I
do
n't
care
if
you
do
ooh
'Cause
in
a
sky
'cause
in
a
sky
full
of
stars
I
think
I
see
you
'Cause
you
're
a
sky
you
're
a
sky
full
of
stars
Such
a
heavenly
view
You
're
such
a
heavenly
view
I
'm
a
princess
cut
from
marble
smoother
than
a
storm
And
the
scars
that
mark
my
body
they
're
silver
and
gold
My
blood
is
a
flood
of
rubies
precious
stones
It
keeps
my
veins
hot
the
fires
find
a
home
in
me
I
move
through
town
I
'm
quiet
like
a
fight
And
my
necklace
is
of
rope
I
tie
it
and
untie
it
And
now
people
talk
to
me
but
nothing
ever
hits
home
People
talk
to
me
and
all
the
voices
just
burn
holes
I
'm
done
with
it
ooh
This
is
the
start
of
how
it
ever
ends
They
used
to
shout
my
name
now
they
whisper
it
I
'm
speeding
up
and
this
is
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
We
're
at
the
start
the
colors
disappear
I
never
watch
the
stars
there
's
so
much
down
here
So
I
just
try
to
keep
up
with
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
I
dream
all
year
but
they
're
not
the
sweet
kinds
And
the
shivers
move
down
my
shoulder
blades
in
double
time
And
now
people
talk
to
me
I
'm
slipping
out
of
reach
now
People
talk
to
me
and
all
their
faces
blur
But
I
got
my
fingers
laced
together
and
I
made
a
little
prison
And
I
'm
locking
up
everyone
who
ever
laid
a
finger
on
me
I
'm
done
with
it
ooh
This
is
the
start
of
how
it
ever
ends
They
used
to
shout
my
name
now
they
whisper
it
I
'm
speeding
up
and
this
is
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
We
're
at
the
start
the
colors
disappear
I
never
watch
the
stars
there
's
so
much
down
here
So
I
just
try
to
keep
up
with
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
And
this
is
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
And
this
is
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat-beat-beat-beat
My
house
in
Budapest
My
hidden
treasure
chest
Golden
grand
piano
My
beautiful
Castillo
For
you
You
I‚Äôd
leave
it
all
My
acres
of
a
land
I
have
achieved
It
may
be
hard
for
you
to
Stop
and
believe
But
for
you
You
I‚Äôd
Leave
it
all
Give
me
one
good
reason
Why
I
should
never
make
a
change
And
baby
if
you
hold
me
Then
all
of
this
will
go
away
My
many
artifacts
The
list
goes
on
If
you
just
say
the
words
I‚Äôll
up
and
run
Oh
to
you
You
I‚Äôd
leave
it
all
Give
me
one
good
reason
Why
I
should
never
make
a
change
And
baby
if
you
hold
me
Then
all
of
this
will
go
away
Give
me
one
good
reason
Why
I
should
never
make
a
change
And
baby
if
you
hold
me
Then
all
of
this
will
go
away
My
friends
and
family
They
don‚Äôt
understand
They
fear
they‚Äôd
lose
so
much
If
you
took
my
hand
But
for
you
You
I‚Äôd
lose
it
all
Give
me
one
good
reason
Why
I
should
never
make
a
change
And
baby
if
you
hold
me
Then
all
of
this
will
go

Give

one

Why
I
should
never

And
baby
if
you

Then
all
of

My
house
in
Budapest
My
hidden
treasure
chest
Golden
grand

My
beautiful
castillo
You
You
I‚Äôd
leave
it
all
They
say
we
are
what
we
are
But
we
do
n't
have
to
be
I
'm
on
bad
behavior
but
I
do
it
in
the
best
way
I
'll
be
the
watcher
Of
the
eternal
flame
I
'll
be
the
guard
dog
Of
all
your
fever
dreams
I
am
the
sand
in
the
bottom
half
Of
the
hourglass
glass
glass
I
try
to
picture
me
without
you
but
I
ca
n't
'Cause
we
could
be
immortals
immortals
Just
not
for
long
for
long
And
live
with
me
forever
now
Pull
the
blackout
curtains
down
Just
not
for
long
for
long
Because
we
could
be
immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Sometimes
the
only
payoff
For
having
any
faith
Is
when
it
's
tested
again
and
again
everyday
I
'm
still
comparing
your
past
to
my
future
It
might
be
your
wound
but
they
're
my
sutures
I
am
the
sand
in
the
bottom
half
Of
the
hourglass
glass
glass
I
try
to

without

I

Because

Immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Give
me
the
flammable
life
I
'm
cold
as
a
match
Ready
to
strike
So
here
I
go
Here
lies
a
city
on
fire
Singing
along
The
arsonist
choir
Now
here
I
go
It
started
with
a
spark
And
burned
into
the
dark
Now
here
I
go
There
is
a
river
I
've
found
Into
the
wild
Under
the
ground
So
here
I
go
A
button
on
a
string
And
I
heard
everything
Now
here
I
go
well
Oh
sweet
ignition
be
my
fuse
You
have
no
choice
you
have
to
choose
Bid
farewell
to
yesterday
Say
goodbye
I
'm
on
my
way
But
in
the
end
we
all
Come
from
what
's
come
before
So
here
I
go
Well
Oh
sweet
ignition
be
my
fuse
You
have
no
choice
you
have
to
choose
Bid
farewell
to
yesterday
Say
goodbye
I
'm
on
my
way
I
threw
it
all
away
because
I
had
to
be
what
never
was
Been
so
hungry
I
could
lie
You
took
my
word
I
took
your
wine
And
I
held
you
in
my
bloody
hands
These
rattled
bones
and
rubber
bands
Washed
them
in
the
muddy
water
Looking
for
a
dime
and
found
a
quarter
But
you
ca
n't
make
me
change
my
name
You
'll
never
make
me
change
my
name
Pay
no
mind
now
ai
n't
that
something
Fuck
it
all
I
came
from
nothing
I
'm
something
From
nothing
You
are
my
fuse
I
'm
something
From
nothing
You
are
my
fuse
It
goes
oh
oh
oh
Oh
oh
oh
Oh
oh
oh
It
goes
oh
oh
oh
All
rise
No
you
ca
n't
make
me
change
my
name
You
'll
never
make
me
change
my
name
Pay
no
mind
now
ai

that
something
Fuck

I
came
from
nothing
I
'm

From

I
'm
something
From
nothing
Did
you
stand
there
all
alone
Oh
I
can
not
explain
what
's
going
down
I
can
see
you
standing
next
to
me
In
and
out
somewhere
else
right
now
You
sigh
look
away
I
can
see
it
clear
as
day
Close
your
eyes
so
afraid
Hide
behind
that
baby
face
Do
do
do
do
do
do
You
can
drive
all
night
Looking
for
answers
in
the
pouring
rain
You
wan
na

peace
of
mind
Looking
for
the
answer
Funny
how
it
seems
like
yesterday
As
I
recall
you
were
looking
out
of
place
Gathered
up
your
things
and
slipped
away
No
time
at
all
I
followed
you
into
the
hall
Cigarette
daydream
You
were
only
seventeen
Soft
speak
with
a
mean
streak
Nearly
brought
me
to
my
knees
Do
do
do
do
do
do
You
can
drive
all
night
Looking
for
the
answers
in
the
pouring
rain
You
wan
na

peace
of
mind
Looking
for
the
answer
If
we
could
find
a
reason
a
reason
to
change
Looking
for
the
answer
If
you
could
find
a
reason
a
reason
to
stay
Standing
in
the
pouring
rain
Do

Do

You

Looking

Better

Waitin‚Äô

To

Spend
some
time
to

in
outer
space
Find
another
planet

the
same
mistakes
Our
mind‚Äôs
all
shattered
when
we
climb
aboard
Hopin‚Äô
for
the
scientists
to
find
another
door
You
did
n't
close
the
door
Left
it
cracked
open
I
could
n't
ignore
the
fine
possibility
Of
having
opened
this
insanity
That
we
still
could
be
But
we
're
stuck
floating
in
between
Put
me
on
the
shelf
as
I
blame
myself
Do
n't
light
those
sparks
I
got
Shattering
anything
That
has
reflections
of
you
You
Our
eyes
were
closed
With
hearts
open
wide
Just
missed
every
rule
to
abide
by
Our
bodies
are
less
than
layers
of
shy
Revealing
the
truth
that
was
buried
inside
Find
our
feelings
And
now
they
're
busting
out
it
seems
Put
me
on
the
shelf
as
I
blame
myself
Do
n't
light
those
sparks
I
got
Shattering
anything
That
has
reflections
of
you
You
I
'm
sure
of
what
of
my
dreams
Seem
to
stolen
my
slumber
And
awake
in
denial
For
the
life
within
me
that
is
better
than
any
other
Reaching
other
sides
and
never
ending
lights
There
ca
n't
be
seem
but
to
ban
this
dream
away
Put
me
on
the
shelf
as
I
blame
myself
Do
n't
light
those
sparks
I
got
Shattering
anything
That
has
reflections
of
you
You
Boys
workin
on
empty
Is
that
the
kinda
way
to
face
the
burning
heat
I
just
think
about
my
baby
I
'm
so
full
of
love
I
could
barely
eat
There
's
nothing
sweeter
than
my
baby
I
never
want
once
from
the
cherry
tree
Cause
my
baby
's
sweet
as
can
be
She
give
me
toothaches
just
from
kissin
me
When
my
time
comes
around
Lay
me
gently
in
the
cold
dark
earth
No
grave
can
hold
my
body
down
I
'll
crawl
home
to
her
That
's
when
my
baby
found
me
I
was
three
days
on
a
drunken
sin
I
woke
with
her
walls
around
me
Nothin
in
her
room
but
an
empty
crib
And
I
was
burnin
up
a
fever
I
did
n't
care
much
how
long
I
lived
But
I
swear
I
thought
I
dreamed
her
She
never
asked
me
once
about
the
wrong
I
did
When
my
time
comes
around
Lay
me
gently
in
the
cold
dark
earth
No
grave
can
hold
my
body
down
I
'll
crawl
home
to
her
When
my
time
comes
around
Lay
me
gently
in
the
cold
dark
earth
No
grave
can
hold
my
body
down
I
'll
crawl
home
to
her
My
baby
never
fret
none
About
what
my
hands
and
my
body
done
If
the
Lord
do
n't
forgive
me
I
'd
still
have
my
baby
and
my
babe
would
have
me
When
I
was
kissing
on
my
baby
And
she
put
her
love
down
soft
and
sweet
In
the
lowland
plot
I
was
free
Heaven
and
hell
were
words
to
me
When
my
time
comes
around
Lay
me
gently
in
the
cold
dark
earth
No
grave
can
hold
my
body
down
I
'll
crawl
home
to
her
When
my
time
comes
around
Lay
me
gently
in
the
cold
dark
earth
No
grave
can
hold
my
body
down
I
'll
crawl
home
to
her
Talking
like
we
used
to
do
It
was
always
me
and
you
Shaping
up
and
shipping
out
Check
me
in
and
check
me
out
Do
you
like
walking
in
the
rain
When
you
think
of
love
do
you
think

I
spoke
to
God
today
and
She
said
that
She
's
ashamed
What
have
I
become
What
have
I
done
I
spoke
to
the
devil
today
and
he
swears
he
's
not
to
blame
And
I
understood
'cause
I
feel
the
same
Arms
wide
open
I
stand
alone
I
'm
no
hero
and
I
'm
not
made
of
stone
Right
or
wrong
I
can
hardly
tell
I
'm
on
the
wrong
side
of
heaven
and
the
righteous
side
of
hell
The
wrong
side
of
heaven
and
the
righteous
side
The
righteous
side
of
hell
I
heard
from
God
today
and
She
sounded
just
like
me
What
have
I
done
and
who
have
I
become
I
saw
the
devil
today
and
he
looked
a
lot
like
me
I
looked
away
I
turned
away
Arms
wide
open
I
stand
alone
I
'm
no
hero
and
I
'm
not
made
of
stone
Right
or
wrong
I
can
hardly
tell
I
'm
on
the
wrong
side
of
heaven
and
the
righteous
side
of
hell
The
wrong
side
of
heaven
and
the
righteous
side
The
righteous
side
of
hell
I
'm
not
defending
downward
descending
Falling
further
and
further
away
getting
closer
everyday
I
'm
getting
closer
everyday
To
the
end
to
the
end
the
end
the
end
I
'm
getting
closer
everyday
Arms
wide
open
I
stand
alone
I
'm
no
hero
and
I
'm
not
made
of
stone
Right
or
wrong
I
can
hardly
tell
I
'm
on
the
wrong
side
of
heaven
and
the
righteous
side
of
hell
The
wrong
side
of
heaven
and
the
righteous
side
of
hell
The
wrong
side
of
heaven
and
the
righteous
side
The
righteous
side
of
hell
Nothing
here
to
see
Just
a
kid
like
me
Trying
to
cuss
and
see
Trying
to
figure
it
out
Nothing
better
to
do
When
I
'm
stuck
on
you
And
still
I
'm
here
Trying
to
figure
it
out
Getting
hard
to
sleep
But
it
is
in
my
dreams
But
it
's
killing
me
To
try
and
figure
it
out
Nothing
better
to
do
When
I
'm
stuck
on
you
And
still
I
'm
here
Trying
to
figure
it
out
I
'll
let
it
go
'co
I
wo
n't
see
you
later
and
I
'm
not
allowed
to
talk
it
out
I
said
I
'll
com
I
'll
promise
I
wo
n't
show
but
I
see
you
trying
to
figure
it
out
I
promise
you
I
'll
take
a
bet
on
you
but
you
did
n't
know
I
planned
it
out
I
said
I
'll
go
yeah
I
wo
n't
see
you
later
and
I
'm
not
allowed
to
figure
it
out
Nothing
here
to
see
Just
a

like

Trying

Trying

Nothing

When
I

I
wo

and
I
'm
not
allowed
to
figure
it
out
Stuck
in
the
jet
wash
Bad
trip
I
could
n't
get
off
And
maybe
I
bit
off
more
than
I
could
chew
And
overhead
of
the
aqua
blue
Fall
to
your
knees
bring
on
the
rapture
Blessed
be
the
boys
time
ca
n't
capture
On
film
or
between
the
sheets
I
always
fall
from
your
window
To
the
pitch
black
streets
And
with
the
black
banners
raised
As
the
crooked
smiles
fade
Former
heroes
who
quit
too
late
Just
wan
na
fill
up
the
trophy
case
again
And
in
the
end
I
'd
do
it
all
again
I
think
you
're
my
best
friend
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
kids
are
n't
all
kids
are
n't
alright
I
'll
be
yours
When
it
rains
it
pours
Stay
thirsty
I
'll
be
fine
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
kids
are
n't
all
kids
are
n't
alright
I
'm
not
passive
but
aggressive
Take
note
it
's
not
impressive
Empty
your
sadness
Like
you
're
dumping
your
purse
On
my
bedroom
floor
We
put
your
curse
in
reverse
And
it
's
our
time
now
if
you
want
to
to
be
More
the
war
like
the
carnival
bears
set
free
And
your
love
is
anemic
and
I
ca
n't
believe
That
you
could
n't
see
it
coming
from
me
And
I
still
feel
that
rush
in
my
veins
It
twists
my
head
just
a
bit
too
thin
All
those
people
I
see
In
those
old
photographs
I
've
seen
are
dead
And
in
the
end
I
'd
do
it
all
again
I
think
you
're
my
best
friend
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
kids
are
n't
all
kids
are
n't
alright
I
'll
be
yours
When
it
rains
it
pours
Stay
thirsty
I
'll
be
fine
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
kids
are
n't
all
kids
are
n't
alright
And
sometimes
I
just
want
to
sit
around
And
gaze
at
my
shoes
yeah
And
let
your
dirty
sadness
fill
me
up
Just
like
a
balloon
And
in
the
end
I
'd
do
it
all
again
I
think
you
're
my
best
friend
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
kids
are
n't
all
kids
are
n't
alright
I
'll
be
yours
When
it
rains
it
pours
Stay
thirsty
I
'll
be
fine
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
kids
are
n't
all
kids
are
n't
alright
Babe
there
's
something
tragic
about
you
Something
so
magic
about
you
Do
n't
you
agree
Babe
there
's
something
lonesome
about
you
Something
so
wholesome
about
you
Get
closer
to
me
No
tired
sighs
no
rolling
eyes
no
irony
No
who
cares
no
vacant
stares
no
time
for
me
Honey
you
're
familiar
like
my
mirror
years
ago
Idealism
sits
in
prison
chivalry
fell
on
its
sword
Innocence
died
screaming
honey
ask
me
I
should
know
I
slithered
here
from
Eden
just
to
sit
outside
your
door
Babe
there
's
something
wretched
about
this
Something
so
precious
about
this
Oh
what
a
sin/where
to
begin
It
was
summer
when
I
saw
your
face
But
like
a
teenage
runaway
Oh
god
I
never
thought
we
'd
take
it
that
far
Some
killer
queen
you
are
Now
I
'm
running
and
I
ca
n't
stop
anywhere
I
go
I
think
about
it
everyday
and
night
I
ca
n't
let
go
Man
I
'm
never
the
same
We
were
shot
gun
lovers
I
was
shot
gun
running
away
So
come
a
little
closer
There
was
something
I
could
tell
ya
You
were
such
a
rollercoaster
And
a
killer
queen
you
are
Rollercoaster
I
do
n't
say
no
Rollercoaster
When
you
do
n't
say
no
And
it
's
such
a
rollercoaster
Some
killer
queen
you
are
We
took
the
bones
out
from
the
road
Those
endless
nights
that
we
traveled
we
stole
You
let
your
clothes
fall
to
the
floor
And
lit
a
fire
while
I
waited
for
more
Now
I
'm
running
and
I
wo
n't
stop
I
do
n't
wan
na
go
I
think
about
it
everyday
and
night
I
ca
n't
let
go
And
hey
I
'm
never
the
same
It
's
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
on
a
dirt
road
running
away
So
come
a
little
closer
There
was
something
I
could
tell
ya
You
were
such
a
rollercoaster
And
a
killer
queen
you
are
Rollercoaster
I
do
n't
say
no
Rollercoaster
When
you
do
n't
say
no
And
it
's
such
a
rollercoaster
Some
killer
claimed
it
all
Come
a
little
closer
I
'm
sure
come
a
little
closer
Why
do
n't
you
come
a
little
closer
There
was
something
I
could
tell
ya
You
were
such
a
rollercoaster
Some
killer
queen
you
are
Rollercoaster
I
do
n't
say
no
Rollercoaster
When
you
do
n't
say
no
And
it
's
such
a
rollercoaster
Some
killer
queen
you
are
Rollercoaster
I
do
n't
say
no
Rollercoaster
When
you
do
n't
say
no
And
it
's
such
a
rollercoaster
Some
killer
queen
you
are
As
a
child
you
would
wait
And
watch
from
far
away
But
you
always
knew
that
you
'd
be
the
one
To
work
while
they
all
play
In
youth
you
'd
lay
Awake
at
night
and
scheme
Of
all
the
things
that
you
would
change
But
it
was
just
a
dream
Here
we
are
do
n't
turn
away
now
We
are
the
Warriors
that
built
this
town
Here
we
are
do
n't
turn
away
now
We
are
the
Warriors
that
built
this
town
from
dust
The
time
will
come
When
you
will
have
to
rise
Above
the
best
and
prove
yourself
Your
spirit
never
dies
Farewell
I
've
gone
To
take
my
throne
above
But
do
n't
weep
for
me
'Cause
this
will
be
the
labour
of
my
love
Here
we
are
do
n't
turn
away
now
We
are
the
Warriors
that
built
this
town
Here
we
are
do
n't
turn
away
now
We
are
the
Warriors
that
built
this
town
from
dust
Here
we
are
do
n't
turn
away
now
We
are
the
Warriors
that
built
this
town
Here
we
are
do
n't
turn
away
now
We
are
the
Warriors
that
built
this
town
from
dust
