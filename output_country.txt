He
said
I
've
been
where
you
've
been
before
Down
every
hallway
's
a
slamming
door
No
way
out
no
one
to
come
and
save
me
Wasting
a
life
that
the
Good
Lord
gave
you
There
's
somebody
saying
what
I
'm
saying
to
you
Open
my
eyes
and
told
me
truth
He
said
just
a
little
faith
and
it
'll
all
get
better
So
I
followed
that
preacher
man
down
to
the
river
and
now
I
'm
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Well
I
heard
what
he
said
and
I
went
on
my
way
Did
n't
think
about
it
for
a
couple
of
days
Then
it
hit
me
like
a
lightning
late
one
night
I
was
all
out
of
hoping
all
out
of
fight
Could
n't
fight
back
my
tears
so
I
fell
on
my
knees
Saying
God
if
you
're
there
come
and
rescue
me
Fell
all
pouring
down
from
my
dress
Got
ta
wash
in
the
water
wash
in
the
blur
and
now
I
'm
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
And
now
I
'm
singing
all
along
to
amazing
race
Ca
n't
nobody
wipe
this
smile
off
my
face
Got
joy
in
my
heart
angels
on
my
side
Thinking
about
it
I
saw
the
heart
and
looked
their
head
No
turning
back
leave
everyday
give
it
all
that
I
have
Trusted
someone
bigger
than
me
Ever
since
the
day
that
I
believed
I
am
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
be
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
yeah
I
'm
stronger
Stronger
I
'm
free
Horses
are
running
wide
open
I
just
got
ta
ride
To
those
honky-tonk
bars
that
stay
open
way
past
closing
time
Songs
about
free
thinkin
and
drinking
sure
light
my
fire
That
flame
leaves
a
scar
on
my
heart
like
an
old
branding
iron
Chorus
She
said
rodeo
man
where
are
you
going
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
life
of
a
cowboy
is
no
good
alone
If
you
tear
down
that
fence
of
rusty
barbed
wire
Then
I
'll
lay
down
beside
you
and
be
your
shotgun
rider
Yesterday
's
nothing
but
dust
I
brush
off
my
boots
While
I
'm
wearing
out
roads
do
n't
you
know
that
I
'm
sure
missing
you
If
I
leave
you
'll
be
wondering
when
I
'll
be
back
again
Between
Texas
and
ranchers
and
old
friends
where
do
you
fit
in
Chorus
Chorus
It
was
the
summer
before
the
real
world
started
and
The
deal
was
we
would
get
to
go
if
we
Cleaned
it
up
and
got
it
running
Daddy
's
old
Winnebago
Wing
and
a
prayer
down
65
Five
best
friends
on
four
bald
tires
I
can
still
see
Billy
smiling
When
we
finally
made
it
To
Talladega
boys
raised
up
Whiskey
in
your
glass
here
's
to
turning
up
Slowing
down
and
cars
that
go
real
fast
We
were
laughing
and
living
drinking
and
wishing
And
thinking
as
that
checkered
flag
was
waving
Sure
would
like
to
stay
in
Talladega
Like
a
storm
time
rolls
on
You
ca
n't
hit
pause
as
we
just
did
Most
days
in
life
do
n't
stand
out
But
life
's
about
those
days
that
will
like
Rocking
rando
getting
rowdy
Shooting
roman
candles
at
the
man
in
the
moon
til
the
Alabama
sun
was
breaking
Over
Talladega
boys
raised
up
Whiskey
in
your
glass
here
's
to

Slowing

and

that
go

We
were
laughing
and
living
drinking
and
wishing
And
thinking
as
that
checkered
flag
was
waving
Sure
would
like
to
stay
in
Talladega
When
the
winds
go
cold
and
it
blows
October
I
think
about
us
shoulder
to
shoulder
Like
those
cars
my
thoughts
roll
over
and
over
and
over
In
my
mind
Tonight
I
'm
in
Talladega
boys
raised
up
Whiskey

Slowing

Roll

If
she
was
a
drink
She
'd
be
a
single-barrelled
Bourbon
on
ice
Smooth
with
a
kick
A
chill
and
a
burn
all
At
the
same
time
She
's
Sunday
drive
meets
High
speed
chase
She
ai
n't
just
a
song
She
's
the
whole
mix
tape
She
's
so
complicated
That
's
the
way
God
made
her
Sunshine
mixed
with
A
little
hurricane
Woah-oh-oh
And
she
destroys
me
in
that
t-shirt
And
I
love
her
so
much
it
hurts
I
never
meant
to
fall
like
this
She
do
n't
just
rain
she
pours
That
girl
right
there
's
The
perfect
storm
I
know
how
to
make
her
laugh
Or
blush
or
mad
at
me
But
that
's
OK
there
ai
n't
no
one
More
beautiful
angry
And
she
loves
just
as
deep
As
she
goes
when
she
's
down
The
highs
match
the
lows
Ca
n't
have
one
without
the
other
And
I
love
her
just
the
way
God
made
her
Sunshine
mixed
with
A
little
hurricane
And
she
destroys
me
in
that
t-shirt
And
I
love
her
so
much
it
hurts
I
never
meant
to
fall
like
this
But
she
do
n't
just
rain
she
pours
That
girl
right
there
's
The
perfect
storm
She
's
the
girl
of
a
lifetime
A
guy
like
me
spends
his
whole
life
Looking
for
that
girl
right
there
's
The
perfect
storm
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
She
destroys
me
in
that
t-shirt
I
never
thought
you
'd
pick
up
the
phone
It
's
Friday
night
you
should
be
at
home
at
town
Did
n't
think
you
'd
be
sitting
at
home
all
alone
like
me
Nothing
on
TV
nothing
to
do
Nothing
to
keep
my
mind
off
you
and
me
And
the
way
it
was
Are
you
thinking
'bout
it
now
because
I
could
be
there
in
five
One
more
one
last
time
We
do
n't
have
to
be
lonely
tonight
Need
you
want
you
I
'm

here
We

n't

But

That

Something

that

So

Tuesday
night
crowded
bar
Some
guy
lights
a
cheap
cigar
Bartender
yells
at
him
So
he
walks
out
and
you
walk
in
Right
through
then
cloud
of
smoke
Catcalls
and
dirty
jokes
Scan
the
room
a
couple
times
Find
a
seat
right
next
to
mine
Lonely
eyes
Well
it
sure
looks
like
You
just
might
Be
looking
for
something
For
something
whoa
Look
at
me
And
I
think
You
'll
see
Those
Lonely
Eyes
Do
n't
have
to
be
alone
tonight
They
analyze
your
glass
of
wine
Roll
away
a
pickup
line
Now
and
then
they
check
your
phone
Catch
mine
and
let
'em
go
From
the
little
bit
I
've
seen
They
're
the
perfect
shade
of
green
Next
time
they
come
my
way
Heaven
help
me
make
'em
stay
Lonely
eyes
Well
it
sure
looks
like
You
just
might
Be
looking
for
something
For
something
whoa
Look
at
me
And
I
think
You
'll
see
Those
Lonely
Eyes
Do
n't
have
to
be
alone
tonight
Do
n't
make
me
pay
my
tab
Catch
a
cab
Go
home
and
kick
myself
to
sleep
tonight
Gim
me
a
sign
Just
a
smile
Baby
I
'll
be
glad
to
lose
myself
deep
inside
Lonely
eyes
Lonely
eyes
Sure
looks
like
You
just
might
Be
Looking
for
something
For
something
whoa
Look
at
me
And
I
'll
think
you
'll
see
Those
lonely
eyes
They
do
n't
have
to
be
alone
tonight
Lonely
Eyes
you
do
n't
have
to
be
alone
tonight
If
I
could
be
the
reason
your
hair
's
a
mess
The
bass
drum
beatin
way
down
deep
in
your
chest
If
I
could
be
the
voice
on
your
radio
Then
I
could
be
your
long
ride
home
If
mine
could
be
the
name
that
changes
yours
The
wine
in
your
glass
The
swing
on
your
porch
The
dollar
in
your
pocket
And
the
peaceful
in
your
sleep
Then
I
'd
be
what
you
mean
to
me
Standing
here
Watching
you
Turning
every
head
in
this
crowded
room
The
lights
down
low
Dancin
slow
Oh
if
falling
's
how
you
feel
And
perfect
is
what
you
see
Then
I
'd
be
what
you
mean
to
me
If
I
could
be
the
fire
in
your
firefly
The
cool
in
the
rain
The
spark
in
your
eye
The
answer
to
your
prayer
And
the
faith
that
sets
you
free
Then
I
'd
be
what
you
mean
to
me
Standing
here
Watching
you
Turning
every
head
in
this
crowded
room
The
lights
down
low
Dancin
slow
Oh
if
falling
's
how
you
feel
And
perfect
is
what
you
see
Then
I
'd
be
what
you
mean
to
me
What
you
mean
to
me
And
oh
All
of
this
talkin
makes
you
laugh
But
I
've
got
ta
let
you
know
just
how
I
'm
feeling
while
I

Standing
here
Watching
you
Turning

head
in
this
crowded
room
The
lights
down

Dancin

Oh

And

You

all
the
time
And
I
do

you
but
I

n't

And

And

Cause

And

So

Another

We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
Our
favorite
doors
are
always
locked
On
a
higher
hill
with
a
taller
top
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
We
ai
n't
happy
where
we
are
There
's
greener
grass
in
the
neighbors
yard
A
bigger
house
and
a
faster
car
We
ai
n't
happy
where
we
are
All
I
want
is
what
I
had
I
'll
trade
it
all
just
to
get
her
back
She
's
moving
on
But
I
guess
I
'm
not
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
We
all
wish
it
did
n't
hurt
When
you
try
your
best
but
it
does
n't
work
And
goodbye
's
such
a
painful
word
We
all
wish
it
did
n't
hurt
All
I
want
is
what
I
had
See
I
'd
trade
it
all
just
to
get
her
back
She
's
moving
on
But
I
guess
I
'm
not
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
You
see
I
wanted
the
world
until
my
whole
world
stopped
A
love
like
that
ai
n't
easily
forgot
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
The
joke
's
on
me
and
it
ai
n't
funny
Everybody
but
me
could
see
the
punch
line
coming
a
mile
away
I
've
heard
it
so
many
times
I
can
tell
it
to
the
T
Believe
me
I
could
sell
it
all
day
It
goes
A
guy
walks
into
a
bar
orders
a
drink
Sees
a
girl
that
catches
his
eye
Asks
her
if
she
wants
another
They
fall
for
each
other
and
end
up
lovers
They
laugh
cry
hold
on
tight
make
it
work
for
a
little
while
Then
one
night
her
taillights
fade
out
into
the
dark
And
a
guy
walks
into
a
bar
I
'd
laugh
too
if
my
heart
would
let
me
Keeping
it
light
will
probably
help
to
get
me
over
you
I
'm
walking
talking
drinking
proof
A
cliché
in
a
corner
booth
Ai
n't
nothing

Ever
since
you
left
me
I
've
been
ridin
'round
cranking
up
a
little
country
gold
heartbreak
Cried
and
dried
these
tears
I
do
n't
know
how
much
more
missin
you
I
can
take
I
prayed

For
a

Now

it
is
in
the
window
It
's
about
time
damn
time
There’s
a
neon
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
It
ain’t
all
that
bright
but
even
though
it’s
subtle
It’s
got
me
feeling
alright
gon
na
make
it
a
double
There’s

I
take
a
shot
of
I
do
n't
care
what
you
're
doing
now
Chase
that
one
with
a
cold
screw
you
When
that
's
done
I
just
might
wash
it
down
With
a
big
pitcher
of
someone
new
That
blond
blonde
blonde
At
the
bar
bar

See
if
she
wants
to
try
and
break
my
heart

There’s

of
the
tunnel
It

It’s

There’s

at
the
end
of
the
tunnel

When
we
were
together
I
thought
life
would
suck
forever
Even
though
I
knew
better
than
the
pain
would
never
end
They
say
the
night
's
darkest
just
before
the
dawn
Gets
kissed
by
the
day
break
got
down
on
my
knees
And
I
prayed
prayed
prayed
For
a
sign
sign

Now
there
it
is
in
the
window
It
's
about
time
damn

Do
