Nice

Magic

You

Love

New

heard

me
So

I
'm

Grab

hand
I
could
make
the
bad
guys
good
for
a
weekend
So
it
's
gon
na
be
forever
Or
it
's
gon
na
go
down
in
flames
You
can
tell
me
when
it
's
over
mm
If
the
high
was
worth
the
pain
Got
a
long
list
of
ex-lovers
They
'll
tell
you
I
'm
insane
'Cause
you
know
I
love
the
players
And
you
love
the
game
'Cause
we
're
young
and
we
're
reckless
We
'll
take
this
way
too
far
It
'll
leave
you
breathless
mm
Or
with
a
nasty
scar
Got
a
long
list
of
ex-lovers
They
'll
tell
you
I
'm
insane
But
I
got
a
blank
space
baby
And
I
'll
write
your
name
Cherry
lips
crystal
skies
I
could
show
you
incredible
things
Stolen
kisses
pretty
lies
You

the
king
baby
I
'm
your
queen
Find

Be

Wait

Oh

Screaming

storms

the
tables
turn
Rose
garden
filled
with
thorns
Keep
you
second
guessing
like
Oh

god
who
is
she
I
get
drunk
on
jealousy
But
you
'll
come
back
each
time
you

'Cause

I
'm
a
nightmare
dressed
like
a
daydream
So

You

I

You

unfaithful
Now

Your
heart
is
unobtainable
Even

n't
share
mine
You
say
I
'm

I
know
I
'm
not
the
only
one
I
have
loved
you
for

Maybe
I

You
've
made
me
realize
my
deepest
fear
By
lying
and
tearing
us
up
You
say
I
'm
crazy
'Cause
you
do
n't

My
lover
's
got
humor
She
's
the
giggle
at
a
funeral
Knows
everybody
's
disapproval
I
should
've
worshipped
her
sooner
If
the
Heavens
ever
did
speak
She
is
the
last
true
mouthpiece
Every
Sunday
's
getting
more
bleak
A
fresh
poison
each
week
We
were
born
sick
You
heard
them
say
it
My
church
offers
no
absolutes
She
tells
me
worship
in
the
bedroom
The
only
heaven
I
'll
be
sent
to
Is
when
I
'm
alone
with
you
I
was
born
sick
but
I
love
it
Command
me
to
be
well
Amen
amen
amen
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
If
I
'm
a
pagan
of
the
good
times
My
lover
's
the
sunlight
To
keep
the
Goddess
on
my
side
She
demands
a
sacrifice
To
drain
the
whole
sea
get
something
shiny
Something
meaty
for
the
main
course
That
's
a
fine
looking
high
horse
What
you
got
in
the
stable
We
've
a
lot
of
starving
faithful
That
looks
tasty
That
looks
plenty
This
is
hungry
work
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
my
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
my
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
No
masters
or
kings
when
the
ritual
begins
There
is
no
sweeter
innocence
Than
our
gentle
sin
In
the

The

The

You

me
scattered
in

Shining

stars
and
screaming
Lighting
me
up

Venus
But

disappear
and
make
me
wait
And

Heroin
drip

Finding
a

go
Baby

This

fairytale
No

endings
No

sails
But

a
life
without
Breathless
moments
Breaking
me

My

Touch
the

Everytime

I
'm
slowly
drifting
away
drifting

Wave

wave
wave

I

slowly
drifting
drifting

And

Pulling

Pulling

the
stream
I
wish
I
could
make
it
easy
Easy
to

But

to
find
a
way
I

stuck
here
in

I

I

Wave

I

slowly
drifting

No

If
we
met
at
midnight
In
the
hanging
tree
I
met
this
girl
late
last
year
She
said
Do
n't
you
worry
if
I
disappear
I
told
her
I
'm
not
really
looking
for
another
mistake
I
called
an
old
friend
thinking
that
the
trouble
would
wait
But
then
I
jumped
right
in
a
week
later
returned
I
reckon
she
was
only
looking
for
a
lover
to
burn
But
I
gave
her
my
time
for
two
or
three
nights
Then
I
put
it
on
pause
until
the
moment
was
right
I
went
away
four
months
until
our
paths
crossed
again
She
told
me
I
was
never
looking
for
a
friend
Maybe
you
could
swing
by
my
room
around
ten
Baby
bring
the
lemon
and
a
bottle
of
gin
We
'll
be
in
between
the
sheets
till
the
late
AM
Baby
if
you
wanted
me
then
should
have
just
said
she
's
singing
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
That
heart
is
so
cold
All
over
my
arm
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
I
told
her
she
knows
Take
aim
and
reload
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
For
a
couple
weeks
I
only
wan
na
see
her
We
drink
away
the
days
with
a
takeaway
pizza
Before
a
text
message
was
the
only
way
to
reach
her
Now
she
's
staying
at
my
place
and
loves
the
way
I
treat
her
Singing
out
all
over
the
track
like
a
feature
And
never
wants
to
sleep
I
guess
that
I
do
n't
want
to
either
But
me
and
her
we
make
money
the
same
way
Four
cities
two
planes
the
same
day
And
those
shows
have
never
been
what
it
's
about
But
maybe
we
'll
go
together
and
just
figure
it
out
I
'd
rather
put
on
a
film
with
you
and
sit
on
a
couch
But
we
should
get
on
a
plane
or
we
'll
be
missing
it
now
Wish
I
'd
have
written
it
down
the
way
that
things
played
out
But
she
was
kissing
him
how
I
was
confused
about
She
should
figure
it
out
while
I
'm
sat
here
singing
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
That
heart
is
so
cold
All
over
my
arm
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
I
told
her
she
knows
Take
aim
and
reload
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Knock
knock
knock
on
my
hotel
door
I
do
n't
even
know
if
she
knows
what
for
She
was
crying
on
my
shoulder
but
I
already
told
ya
Trust
and
respect
is
what
we
do
this
for
I
never
intended
to
be
next
But
you
did
n't
need
to
take
him
to
bed
that
's
all
And
I
never
saw
him
as
a
threat
Until
you
disappeared
with
him
to
have
sex
of
course
It
's
not
like
we
were
both
on
tour
We
were
staying
on
the
same
fucking
hotel
floor
And
I
was
n't
looking
for
a
promise
or
commitment
But
it
was
never
just
fun
and
I
thought
you
were
different
This
is
not
the
way
you
realized
what
you
wanted
It
's
a
bit
too
much
too
late
if
I
'm
honest
All
this
time
God
knows
I
'm
singing
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
That
heart
is
so
cold
All
over
my
arm
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
I
told
her
she
knows
Take
aim
and
reload
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
That
heart
is
so
cold
All
over
my
arm
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
I
told
her
she
knows
Take
aim
and
reload
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
When
your
legs
do
n't
work
like
they
used
to
before
And
I
ca
n't
sweep
you
off
of
your
feet
Will
your
mouth
still
remember
the
taste
of
my
love
Will
your
eyes
still
smile
from
your
cheeks
And
darling
I
will
be
loving
you
till
we
're
70
And
baby
my
heart
could
still
fall
as
hard
at
23
And
I
'm
thinking
'bout
how
people
fall
in
love
in
mysterious
ways
Maybe
just
the
touch
of
a
hand
Oh
me
I
fall
in
love
with
you
every
single
day
And
I
just
wan
na
tell
you
I
am
So
honey
now
Take
me
into
your
loving
arms
Kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
Place
your
head
on
my
beating
heart
I
'm
thinking
out
loud
That
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are
When
my
hair
's
overgone
and
my
memory
fades
And
the
crowds
do
n't
remember
my
name
When
my
hands
do
n't
play
the
strings
the
same
way
I
know
you
will
still
love
me
the
same
Cause
honey
your
soul
can
never
grow
old
It
's
ever
green
Baby
your
smile
forever
in
my
mind
and
memory
And
I
'm
thinking
'bout
how
people
fall
in
love
in
mysterious
ways
Maybe
it
's
all
part
of
a
plan
I
'll
just
keep
on
making
the
same
mistakes
Hoping
that
you
'll
understand
But
baby
now
Take
me
into
your
loving
arms
Kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
Place
your
head
on
my
beating
heart
Thinking
out
loud
That
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are
So
baby
now
Take
me
into
your
loving
arms
Kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
Oh
darling
place
your
head
on
my
beating
heart
I
'm
thinking
out
loud
That
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are
Oh
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are
And
we
found
love
right
where
we
are
We
go
hideaway
in
daylight
We
go
undercover
when
under
sun
Got
a
secret
side
in
plain
sight
Where
the
streets
are
empty
Thatâ€™s
where
we
run
Everyday
people
do
Everyday
things
but
I
Canâ€™t
be
one
of
them
I
know
you
hear
me
now
We
are
a
different
kind
We
can
do
anything
We
could
be
heroes
We
could
be
heroes
Me
and
you
We
could
be
heroes
We
could
be
heroes
Me
and
you
We
could
be
Anybodyâ€™s
got
the
power
They
donâ€™t
see
it
â€˜Cos
they
donâ€™t
understand
Spin
around
and
run
for
hours
You
and
me
we
got
the
world
in
our
hands
Everyday
people
do
Everyday
things
but
I
Canâ€™t
be
one
of
them
I
know
you
hear
me
now
We
are
a
different
kind
We
can
do
anything
We
could
be
heroes
We
could
be
heroes
Me
and
you
We
could
be
heroes
We
could
be
heroes
Me
and
you
We
could
be
We
could
be
heroes
We
could
be
heroes
Me
and
you
We
could
be
I
keep
going
to
the
river
to
pray
'Cause
I
need
something
that
can
wash
off
the
pain
And
at
most
I
'm
sleeping
all
these
demons
away
But
your
ghost
the
ghost
of
you
it
keeps
me
awake
My
friends
had
you
figured
out
Yeah
they
saw
what
's
inside
of
you
You
tried
hiding
another
you
But
your
evil
was
coming
through
These
guys
sitting
on
the
wall
They
watch
every
move
I
make
Bright
light
living
in
the
shade
Your
cold
heart
makes
my
spirit
shake
I
had
to
go
through
hell
to
prove
I
'm
not
insane
Had
to
meet
the
devil
just
to
know
his
name
And
that
's
when
my
love
was
burning
Yeah
it
's
still
burning
I
keep
going
to
the
river
to
pray
'Cause
I
need
something
that

Each
time
that
I
think
you
go
I
turn
around
and
you
're
creeping
in
And
I
let
you
under
my
skin
'Cause
I
love
living
in
the
sin
Boy
you
never
told
me
True
love
was
going
to
hurt
True
pain
I
do
n't
deserve
Truth
is
that
I
never
learn
I
keep
going

Hoping

fall
Hope
when
the
water

You
built
a
wall
Hoping
the
crowd
screams
out
Screaming
your

Hope
if
everybody
runs
You
chose
to
stay
Hope
that
you
fall
in
love
And
it
hurts
so
bad
The
only
way

know
Is
give

I
did
Of

broken
bone
I
swear
I
lived
Hope
that
you
spend
your
days
But
they
all
add
up
And
when
that
sun
goes
down
Hope
you
raise
your
cup
I
wish
that
I
could
witness
All
your
joy
And
your
pain
But
until
my
moment
comes
I
'll
say
I
I
did
it
all
I
I
did
it
all
I

every

Of

Woah

Of

Of
