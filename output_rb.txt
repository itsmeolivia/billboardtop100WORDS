The
other
night
Lavish
Lee
told
me
that
I
'm
all
these
people
listen
to
She
said
they
love
me
unconditional
Imagine
how
it
feel
to
watch
another
nigga
at
the
top
You
know
that
if
you
was
n't
you
you
would
be
dissin
you
dawg
Damn
okay
from
that
perspective
I
see
what
you
're
talkin
'bout
no
way
to
soften
that
Cause
me
I
was
tryna
find
out
where
I
lost
'em
at
But
maybe
I
ai
n't
lose
'em
at
all
Maybe
I
keep
movin
forward
and
they
're
just
stagnant
they
ai
n't
movin
at
all
But
when
they
need
a
favor
who
do
they
call
Maybe
I
'm
searchin
for
the
problems
askin
what
was
said
and
who
was
involved
Too
focused
on
people
's
feedback
and
provin
'em
wrong
They
say
the
shoe
can
always
fit
no
matter
whose
foot
it
's
on
These
days
feel
like
I
'm
squeezin
in
'em
Whoever
wore
'em
before
just
was
n't
thinkin
big
enough
I
'm
'bout
to
leave
'em
with
'em
Cause
if
I
run
in
the
game
in
these
man
the
seams
are
splittin
No
pun
intended
but
they
're
smellin
defeat
in
the
air
Headed
where
nobody
took
it
who
meetin
me
there
They
tell
him
that
he
's
talkin
crazy
but
he
does
n't
care
Bein
humble
do
n't
work
as
well
as
bein
aware
Listen

You

Let

And
I
'm
the
one
to

Probably

You
should
hit
when
you
tired
of
playing
up
in
the
house
and
ai
n't
nobody
around
You
need
that
When
you
need
that
late
night
We
can
both
make
love
to
the
daylight
You

But

Nah

All
I

do
So

a
couple
bands
with
a
nigga
like
me
Loving

same
with
a
nigga

You

Do

When

But
that
is
when
