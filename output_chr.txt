He
said
I
've
been
where
you
've
been
before
Down
every
hallway
's
a
slamming
door
No
way
out
no
one
to
come
and
save
me
Wasting
a
life
that
the
Good
Lord
gave
you
There
's
somebody
saying
what
I
'm
saying
to
you
Open
my
eyes
and
told
me
truth
He
said
just
a
little
faith
and
it
'll
all
get
better
So
I
followed
that
preacher
man
down
to
the
river
and
now
I
'm
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Well
I
heard
what
he
said
and
I
went
on
my
way
Did
n't
think
about
it
for
a
couple
of
days
Then
it
hit
me
like
a
lightning
late
one
night
I
was
all
out
of
hoping
all
out
of
fight
Could
n't
fight
back
my
tears
so
I
fell
on
my
knees
Saying
God
if
you
're
there
come
and
rescue
me
Fell
all
pouring
down
from
my
dress
Got
ta
wash
in
the
water
wash
in
the
blur
and
now
I
'm
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
And
now
I
'm
singing
all
along
to
amazing
race
Ca
n't
nobody
wipe
this
smile
off
my
face
Got
joy
in
my
heart
angels
on
my
side
Thinking
about
it
I
saw
the
heart
and
looked
their
head
No
turning
back
leave
everyday
give
it
all
that
I
have
Trusted
someone
bigger
than
me
Ever
since
the
day
that
I
believed
I
am
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
be
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
yeah
I
'm
stronger
Stronger
I
'm
free
You
call
me
out
upon
the
waters
The
great
unknown
where
feet
may
fail
And
there
I
find
You
in
the
mystery
In
oceans
deep
My
faith
will
stand
And
I
will
call
upon
Your
name
And
keep
my
eyes
above
the
waves
When
oceans
rise
My
soul
will
rest
in
Your
embrace
For
I
am
Yours
and
You
are
mine
Your
grace
abounds
in
deepest
waters
Your
sovereign
hand
Will
be
my
guide
Where
feet
may
fail
and
fear
surrounds
me
You
've
never
failed
and
You
wo
n't
start
now
So
I
will
call
upon
Your
name
And
keep
my
eyes
above
the
waves
When
oceans
rise
My
soul
will
rest
in
Your
embrace
For
I
am
Yours
and
You
are
mine
Spirit
lead
me
where
my
trust
is
without
borders
Let
me
walk
upon
the
waters
Wherever
You
would
call
me
Take
me
deeper
than
my
feet
could
ever
wander
And
my
faith
will
be
made
stronger
In
the
presence
of
my
Savior
I
will
call
upon
Your
Name
Keep
my
eyes
above
the
waves
My
soul
will
rest
in
Your
embrace
I
am
Yours
and
You
are
mine
Bring
your
tired
And
bring
your
shame
Bring
your
guilt
And
bring
your
pain
Don’t
you
know
that’s
not
you’re
name
You
will
always
be
much
more
to
me
Every
day
I
wrestle
with
the
voices
That
keep
telling
me
I’m
not
right
But
that’s
alright
‘Cause
I
hear
a
voice
and
He
calls
me
redeemed
When
others
say
I’ll
never
be
enough
And
greater
is
the
One
living
inside
of
me
Than
he
who
is
living
in
the
world
In
the
world
In
the
world
And
greater
is
the
One
living
inside
of
me
Than
he
who
is
living
in
the
world
Bring
your
doubts
And
bring
your
fears
Bring
your
hurt
And
bring
your
tears
There’ll
be
no
condemnation
here
You
are
holy
righteous
and
redeemed
Every
time
I
fall
There’ll
be
those
who
will
call
me
A
mistake
Well
that’s
OK
‘Cause
I
hear
a
voice
and
He
calls
me
redeemed
When
others
say
I’ll
never
be
enough
And
greater
is
the
One
living
inside
of
me
Than
he
who
is
living
in
the
world
In
the
world
In
the
world
And
greater
is
the
One
living
inside
of
me
Than
he
who
is
living
in
the
world
He’s
Greater
He’s
Greater
There’ll
be
days
I
lose
the
battle
Grace
says
that
it
doesn’t
matter
‘Cause
the
cross
already
won
the
war
He’s
Greater
He’s
Greater
I
am
learning
to
run
freely
Understanding
just
how
He
sees
me
And
it
makes
me
love
Him
more
and
more
He’s
Greater
He’s
Greater
There’ll
be
days
I

Grace

My

He’s

Than

I
am
guilty
Ashamed
of
what
I’ve
done
what
I’ve
become
These
hands
are
dirty
I
dare
not
lift
them
up
to
the
Holy
one
You
plead
my
cause
You
right
my
wrongs
You
break
my
chains
You
overcome
You
gave
Your
life
To
give
me
mine
You
say
that
I
am
free
How
can
it
be
How
can
it
be
I’ve
been
hiding
Afraid
I’ve
let
you
down
inside
I
doubt
That
You
still
love
me
But
in
Your
eyes
there’s
only
grace
now
You
plead
my
cause
You
right
my
wrongs
You
break
my
chains
You
overcome
You
gave
Your
life
To
give
me
mine
You
say
that
I
am
free
How
can
it
be
How
can
it
be
Though
I
fall
You
can
make
me
new
From
this
death
I
will
rise
with
You
Oh
the
grace
reaching
out
for
me
How
can
it
be
How
can
it
be
You
plead
my
cause
You
right
my
wrongs
You
break
my
chains
You
overcome
You
gave
Your
life
To
give
me
mine
You
say
that
I
am
free
How
can
it
be
How
can
it
be
I
see
the
work
of
Your
Hands
Galaxies
spin
in
a
Heavenly
dance
oh
God
All
that
You
are
is
so
overwhelming
I
hear
the
sound
of
Your
Voice
All
at
once
it
's
a
gentle
and
thundering
noise
oh

All
that
You
are

I
delight
myself
in
You
Captivated
by
Your
beauty
I

Unashamed
because

by
You
I

the
power
of
Your
Cross
Forgiven
and
free
forever
You
'll
be
my
God
And
all
that
You
've
done
is

I

Glory
of
Your
Presence
I

I

by
You
And

I
run
into
Your

Unashamed

What
do
you
think
about
when
you
look
at
me
I
know
were
not
the
fairytale
you
dreamed
we
'd
be
You
wore
the
veil
you
walked
the
aisle
you
took
my
hand
And
we
dove
into
a
mystery
How
I
wish
we
could
go
back
to
simpler
times
Before
all
our
scars
and
all
our
secrets
were
in
the
light
Now
on
this
hallowed
ground
we
've
drawn
the
battle
lines
Will
we
make
it
through
the
night
It
's
going
to
take
much
more
than
promises
this
time
Only
God
can
change
our
minds
Maybe
you
and
I
were
never
meant
to
be
complete
Could
we
just
be
broken
together
If
you
can
bring
your
shattered
dreams
and
I
'll
bring
mine
Could
healing
still
be
spoken
and
save
us
The
only
way
we
'll
last
forever
is
broken
together
How
it
must
have
been
so
lonely
by
my
side
We
were
building
kingdoms
and
chasing
dreams
and
left
love
behind
I
'm
praying
God
will
help
our
broken
hearts
align
And
we
wont
give
up
the
fight
It
's
going
to
take
much
more
than
promises
this
time
Only
God
can
change
our
minds
Maybe
you
and
I
were
never
meant
to
be
complete
Could
we
just
be
broken
together
If
you
can
bring
your
shattered
dreams
and
I
'll
bring
mine
Could
healing
still
be
spoken
and
save
us
The
only
way
we
'll
last
forever
is
broken
together
Maybe
you
and
I
were
never
meant
to
be
complete
Could
we
just
be
broken
together
If
you
can
bring
your
shattered
dreams
and
I
'll
bring
mine
Could
healing
still
be
spoken
and
save
us
The
only
way
we
'll
last
forever
is
broken
together
We
met
half
a
dozen
times
I
know
your
name
I
know
you
do
n't
know
mine
But
I
wo
n't
hold
that
against
you
You
come
here
every
Friday
night
I
take
your
order
I
try
to
be
polite
And
hide
what
I
've
been
going
through
If
you
looked
me
right
in
the
eye
Would
you
see
the
pain
deep
inside
Would
you
take
the
time
Tell
me
what
I
need
to
hear
Tell
me
that
I
'm
not
forgotten
Show
me
there
's
a
God
who
can
be
More
than
all
I
've
ever
wanted
'Cuz
right
now
I
need
a
little
hope
I
need
to
know
that
I
'm
not
alone
Maybe
God
is
calling
you
tonight
To
tell
me
something
that
might
save
my
life
I
'm
the
pastor
at
your
church
For
all
these
years
you
've
listened
to
my
words
You
think
I
know
all
the
answers
But
I
've
got
doubts
and
questions
too
Behind
this
smile
I
'm
really
just
like
you
Afraid
and
tired
and
insecure
If
you
looked
me
right
in
the
eye
Would
you
see
the
real
me
inside
Would
you
take
the
time
to
Tell
me
what
I
need
to
hear
Tell
me
that
I
'm
not
forgotten
Show
me
there
's
a
God
who
can
be
More
than
all
I
've
ever
wanted
'Cuz
right
now
I
need
a
little
hope
I
need
to
know
that
I
'm
not
alone
Maybe
God
is
calling
you
tonight
To
tell
me
something
that
might
save
my
life
I
am
just
like
everyone
Jesus
I
need
You
I
need
Your
love
To
save
my
life
Tell
me
what
I
need
to
hear
Tell
me
that
I
'm
not
forgotten
Show
me
You
're
the
God
who
can
be
More
than
all
I
've
ever
wanted
'Cuz
right
now
I
need
a
little
hope
I
need
to
know
that
I
'm
not
alone
I

hear
You
calling
me
tonight
Oh

know
that
You
are
calling
me
tonight
Jesus
only
You
can
save
my
life
Save
my
life
All
I
need
is

Keep

when
my

When
I

And
I
'm
stressed

and
I

tempted
to
get

And

And

And

You

Get

And
you
know
it
's
your
life
And
we
know
that
time
's
running
out
Ca
n't
wait
around
cause
The
time
is
now
I
've
been
a
lot
of
places
where
the
scene
ai
n't
pretty
I
've
seen
plenty
of
hatred
death
and
destruction
where
ignorance
kills
many
The
blind
leading
the
blind
we
turning
a
blind
eye
That
alone
is
a
crime
we
got
the
power
of
life
I
know
that
we
make
mistakes
do
n't
let
'em
keep
you
away
Mercy
love
and
His
grace
is
the
reason
we
move
ahead
Speak
out
though
we
never
been
qualified
to
do
it
I
ai
n't
earned
it
I
was
loved
into
it
I
'm
brand
new
yea
